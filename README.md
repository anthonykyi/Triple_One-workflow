## Things we Learned
1. How to add a LICENSE to the project. We had problems locating the license and confirming it was the correct one. Also, we had trouble understanding what exactly needed to be included in the LICENSE for it to be applied correctly.
2. We learned how to fork and clone our repository. As well as how to add an upstream remote.
3. We learned how to use git terminal.
4. We learned how to add and edit new issues.
